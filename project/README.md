# Final Project
Our final assignment is open-ended. We would like for you to go explore a little bit and try to build something fun of your own interest (that uses an accelerator, of course!)

## Proposal Approval
Have your proposal approved by the teaching staff by 8/24.  After you have had your proposal approved, submit the document to Gradescope.  It is sufficient to print an email to PDF and submit.  This does not have to be a formal proposal.

## Deliverables
Submit a report or video as previously agreed upon to Gradescope.  If you submit a video, submit a PDF to Gradescope which includes a link to the video.  Other deliverables can be managed this way as necessary.

## Late
There is no late submission for this project.
